# angular-tests
Project used to practice different techniques, test libraries u others in a single repository

## Description

With this project, my objective is to practice with Angular, focusing on techniques rather than problem-solving.

These techniques can be related to configurations, tool usage, development techniques (such as TDD, patterns,...), Angular functionalities or SPAs in general (interceptors, authentication), or integration of other libraries (ngrx, material design).

To achieve this, I will create an Angular SPA from a new project that can be generated using the Angular CLI. However, once that is done, it will continue to grow not with the goal of creating a single app, but as a foundation for implementing different functionalities without needing to maintain coherence between them. In other words, the app is the means, not the end.

## Premises

The aim is to write code that, even for specific functionalities (even when it is evident that they won't be modified), is easy to understand by others, maintainable, and minimizes bugs. To achieve this, principles of Clean Code and unit testing will be applied.
